                          <p>SARS-CoV-2 widely known as COVID-19, is a new highly infectious respiratory disease. The virus spreads when a person touches contaminated areas followed by their eyes, nose, or mouth. A person can also get infected when in contact with a carrier, either by coughing, sneezing, and/or talking. When a person is infected, symptoms appear from 1 to 14 days after getting infected. Although the symptoms may vary from one person to another, common symptoms include headaches, fatigue, trouble breathing, fever, cough, and loss of taste and smell.</p>

        <h1 class ='display-3 my-5 font-weight-bold' > SITUATION IN UAE </h1>
        <p> <b>The Start of COVID</b> <br><br>

      In January 2020, the news first started spreading about a new virus originating from Wuhan, China. Most people didn’t take it seriously at first, and that’s because not many knew the severity of the situation. I remember I first heard about it in my English class at school. We had a short discussion about what was happening and many students, including me, knew nothing about it. So, from that day on, we started having short updates about COVID. We shared information about what it is, the symptoms, cure or vaccination, what other countries have been doing, the number of confirmed cases, etc. As the days went by, and the more updates we got, we started to understand how serious this was. We started hearing of neighboring countries already taking action, closing all borders and self-isolating. However, it was not until the beginning of March that the government announced a 2-week break, which to students meant that we have 2 weeks of vacation. We said goodbye to our friends thinking we’ll see them in a fortnight. Not later after that, we went into quarantine, and (at that time) life as we know it has been changed.

      <br><br><b>My Situation</b> <br><br>

      School/Studying<br><br>

      Since I was a senior in high school when the pandemic struck, it is safe to say that my studies, and social life, has been hugely impacted. As a senior, this was meant to be the most important year in my high school career, and the last. I wanted to make the best out of it. To socialize as much as possible and partake in events, as well as studying hard to get the grades I want. When COVID struck, we immediately switched to online learning. To most of us, this was a foreign territory, students and staff members alike. We had to navigate our way through new learning platforms and the challenges that came with it. Many things were cut short, because the school year was almost ending. Most of the time, we had to rely on ourselves to complete exercises, etc. It’s not that help was not offered, but rather we were still getting used to getting the most out of the time our teachers offered to us. When finals season rolled around, the exams were shortened from a 2-hour paper to a 40-minute online form. Our graduation was held online as well, through Microsoft Teams. Each graduate picked up their gowns from school. Either they picked up themselves or got someone to pick it up for them but only one person was allowed inside. Then, we had to take a picture of ourselves (and try to make it look as professional as possible) in our graduation gown. When our graduation video was broadcasted, whenever they’d call a student’s name, their picture will appear on screen.

      <br><br>Socializing<br><br>

      Moreover, as the government issued new rules and regulations as a safety measure against COVID, the social life in the United Arab Emirates got impacted severely. In our culture, family gatherings are the foundation of socializing. It is well known amongst the majority that Fridays are for the family gatherings. People would travel every weekend to other cities, or even emirates, just to attend these gatherings. Just like other people, my family and I travelled from Abu Dhabi city to Alain city every weekend in order to meetup with our family members. These gatherings extend to grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, etc. We’d prepare a huge meal and eat together and spend the rest of the evening chatting and catching up. Often times, these events would last until midnight! But with the safety measures taken, these gatherings were stopped. My family and I had to stay in Abu Dhabi during quarantine as travelling was not permitted. Many families were in the same situation. A huge part of the Emirati culture was brought to a halt for the sake of everyone’s safety.

      <br><br>Ramadan<br><br>

      Similar to gatherings, the Ramadan rituals has also been greatly affected. Ramadan is a holy month in the Islamic calendar. It is when all Muslims refrain from food, water, smoking, etc. To many Muslims, Ramadan has a culture of its own. Not only does one focus on their relationship with Allah, but it’s also a time for bonding with family, friends, and people in our community. Each year, my family and other family in the neighborhood would prepare a huge meal which gets delivered to the local Masjid. People would then break their fast together, pray, and share food. Due to COVID, these rituals were also stopped, as it increased the risk of spreading the virus. So, most people spent Ramadan at home last year. Which was a huge change to all of us. Because the Masjids were closed across the country, congregational prayers were practiced at homes, with members of the family only.

      <br><br>Travelling<br><br>

      Since I got accepted at The University of Manchester, I was looking forward to starting higher education abroad. To me, being accepted into UoM was a door open to a whole new experience, and travelling is a huge part of it. However, it soon became clear that travelling to the UK will be postponed due to the pandemic. The UK went into lockdown for a while, and the Scholarship program I’m enrolled in had stopped accepting traveling requests. I was also advised to study remotely for the rest of the academic year.

  <br><br>  <b>  UAE’s Approach<br><br>
      Guidelines<br><br> </b>
      §  Social Events<br><br>s
      -   	Weddings & Family Occasions:
      The place where the event is taking place should be disinfected, with hand sanitizers widely available. The number of attendees, including family members, must not exceed 10 people. In addition, all attendees must conduct a COVID test 24 hours prior the event. And the use of an open buffet is not allowed.
      -   	Funerals & Associated services:
      No more than 10 people are permitted to attend the funeral and should be educated about the safety measures. All workers at the cemetery must wear masks, disinfect tools before and after burial and wash their hands often with sanitizers.
      -   	General Rules for Social Events:
      People should maintain at least 2 meters social distance and be aware of any symptoms they may develop.
      Preparing an isolation room in the case where COVID is suspected.
      People with chronic illnesses or elderly are advised to avoid social events.

      §  Office & Workplace<br><br>
      Flexible working hours are being offered to prevent overcrowding on desktops and decreasing the capacity of people in a building. Employees must maintain social distancing and are required to wear face masks and glove at all times. Mass sterilization and deep cleaning are to be conducted. To ensure the safety of everyone, employees health is being monitored frequently and protective barriers are being used.

      <br><br><b>COVID tests</b><br><br>
      Many private and public clinics conduct the RT-PCR Test. One can check the list of facilities that offer COVID-19 testing updated by the health authorities. In addition, there are plenty of drive-through centers and stations where the test can be conducted. People of determination can get tested at home through National Home Testing Program for People of Determination.
      §  Types of COVID Testing
      -   	RT-PCR
      This method of testing is considered the standard way of testing in the UAE and perhaps the most common. It is done by taking a nasal swab.
      -   	Antibody Tests
      This test determines whether or not there are any antibodies in one’s bloodstream to show if the person had previously been infected or not.
      -   	Laser -Based DPI Technology
      This test is usually used by the government when they first suspect an infection. Laser technology is used to examine blood samples. It is efficient and doesn’t cost much.

        <h1 class ='display-3 my-5 font-weight-bold' >  SITUATION IN UK</h1>
        <p>   <b>Start of Covid</b> <br><br>
                I first heard news of Covid-19 in early February 2020, back when it first broke out in Wuhan, China. My friends showed me a story on it on the BBC website and I was, at first, sceptical. It seemed to me at this time that the articles were exaggerating the severity of the outbreak. That was until cases started appearing in other countries, and sooner or later Covid had reached the UK. Later on, in late March, schools across the country were closed down, not to reopen again until after the summer break.
                <br><br>  <b>My Situation:</b><br><br>
                Soon after all schools in the UK shut down, it was announced that A-Level exams would be cancelled, therefore no College work was set for me during the first wave of the pandemic. Grades were initially decide through a combination of average progression and teacher predicted grades. However, it came to light that students from poorer areas were consistently being assigned worse grades, so the government was forced to scrap these grades, and all students were instead assigned their teacher predicted grades. However, these grades were not sufficient to progress directly onto my desired university course, so I decided to take a foundation year.
                My experience with online learning began in October, when the first semester of my foundation year began. Lectures were given over Zoom. We were given a schedule in the form of an online calendar. I found it beneficial to arrange a written timetable around these lectures in order to structure my day as if I was still at college.

<br><br>  <b>UK Covid Rules</b><br><br>
-          Face coverings required indoors<br>
-          Free testing for anybody with symptoms<br>
-          Working from home advised<br>
-          Universities advised to facilitate remote learning where possible<br>
-          Support Bubble – 2 households can link and count as one household in order to provide care for a vulnerable person<br>
-          Rule of 6 – 6 people from different households can meet outside in public<br>
-          Or 2 households can meet<br>
-          Supermarkets have one-way systems, though people often ignore them<br>

      <div class="section text-light container-fluid py-4 px-5 " id = "arm">
        <h1 class ='display-3 my-5 font-weight-bold' >  SITUATION IN ARMENIA </h1>
          <p>
             <b>Start ov COVID-19</b><br><br>As of April 12, 2021, Armenia has 203,327 confirmed cases of Covid-19 within its borders with 182,836 confirmed recoveries and 3,753 confirmed deaths.
              <br>First Covid-19 case in Armenia was confirmed on March 1st in 2020. Government’s first response was to close down workplaces, schools and Universities. At first people in Armenia, unlike other countries were in peace and calm. The main problem for the Government was that a lot of people in Armenia didn’t believe the virus to be real and were sure that it is some kind of a lie to scare out the citizens. Due to disbelief some citizens did not follow the rules at all which has put their and others’ lives under risk. <br><br>
              This lead to the next outbreak in Armenia which initiated a woman that arrived from Italy, didn’t quarantine and attended her son’s engagement with around 200 people there. As you may already guessed everyone in the gathering got infected. This lead to further spread and the government failed to stop it at all.
              <br><br>The government regulations were not strict compared to other countries. However, there were precisely protected and guided by the police and other government representatives. Regulations were about closed restaurants, cafes and all workplaces switched to online working schedule. Masks were obligated even for walks and for entering shops gloves were also obligations. However, almost all the regulations were lifted on September 12th, 2020 besides wearing the mask. At this point government started to not care about the situation at all. The main reason mostly was Artsakh war which broke out on the morning of September 27th and lasted until November 10th.
              <br><br>Due to the crucial impact of the war, no one remembered about COVID-19 at all. Furthermore the ongoing everyday funerals with hundreds of people involved, helped Covid to spread even more. At this point, I was also one of the people who were losing their friends day by day on the frontline, so was not attentive with Covid.
              <br><br>Since the Artsakh war, all the rules of wearing masks and going outside are not followed neither by Government officials nor by citizens. The government is not undertaking any measures to correct the situation and for that reason the number of cases had a quick rise in last two weeks. There are no regulations at all for going outside, all the restaurants and cafes are open and everything is working. Armenians now consider COVID-19 to be a normal flu despite it being deadly.
              <br><br>Vaccination has not started yet in Armenia, however Armenian government has already approved the vaccines that are going to be used within the country. The vaccines are Sputnik V, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer-BioNTech.
              <br><br><b>Travel Guidance</b> <br><br>
              Upon entering the territory of the Republic of Armenia via air and land borders travelers will be asked to provide a COVID-19 PCR test certificate with negative results taken within the previous 72 hours.
              <br>•	The certificate should be in Armenian, Russian or English, include the name, surname, date of birth, and passport number of the examined person, printed on the official letterhead of the medical institution conducting the test, identifying all contacts of the organization, test result, signed and sealed by the head of the medical institution.
              <br>•	In order to detect symptoms of infection all passengers are subject to a relevant examination conducted by the Health and Labor Inspectorate immediately upon arrival (including contactless temperature checking, external examination, additional inquiries in case of clinical symptoms typical to the infection).
              <br>•	If corresponding symptoms are detected as a result of examination the person will be hospitalized.
              <br>•	Non-holders of the relevant certificate are subjected to PCR sampling at the airport or border checkpoint sampling points and to compulsory isolation until the negative PCR test result will be obtained.
              <br>•	Sampling points carry out sampling, then submit personal data and registration of self-isolation in the ARMED system on the basis of ID: authenticity of the contact phone number is checked on the ground by calling to the mentioned phone number. After sampling, the sampling point must provide a relevant document indicating the sampling and registration for self-isolation.
              <br>•	The results of the PCR test are registered in the ARMED system and are provided to the examined person within 48 hours.
              <br>•	If a negative PCR test is obtained, the person would be exempted from self-isolation.
              <br>•	The PCR test-related and possible treatment expenses should be covered by the arriving person.
